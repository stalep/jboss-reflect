JBoss Reflect

   Jboss-reflect is a one-stop shop for reflection and byte-code manipulation implemented on top of 
   javassist and java.lang.reflect (or any other byte code tool).

   It is designed to abstract away the implementation specific details of java.lang.reflect and 
   javassist.
   An overview over the different SPI's can be found {{{http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-13272}here}}.

   With the support of Javassist JBoss Reflect support mutable objects. This means that its possible to runtime
   change classes/methods/constructors/fields. Its possible to load the changed objects in runtime or get a 
   bytearray representation of the class which can be saved to disc and loaded later. As in Javassist its not
   possible to change a Class that has already been loaded by the classloader.

*Usage
