/**
 * A class adapter.<p>
 * 
 * A class adapter is the integration point for manipulating
 * class information at runtime, e.g. overriding annotations
 * or obtaining an aop instance advisor.<p>
 * 
 * The class adapter has the following protocol.
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li> Use getClassInfo to obtain information about
 *        the class.
 * <li> Obtain an Instance ClassAdapter if the class information
 *        should be overridden at the instance level, e.g. annotations
 * <li> Obtain the dependencies of the Class/Instance and any
 *       advice factories, e.g. @Depends annotations
 * <li> Obtain the JoinpointFactory so the instance can be
 *       constructed.
 * </ol>
